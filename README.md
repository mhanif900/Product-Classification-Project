Product Classification Project

Hello!

This is my data science final project after completing a course at shift academy. The Project is a Product classification of a beauty marketplace called "SEPHORA". The aim of this project is to find whether a product is exclusive or not. Exclusive in this case means that a product only sold on this online platform. So, there will be no other places or platforms that sell that exclusive product. Besides that, We also find any variable that gives an important effect to the dependent variable. In the end by knowing what variable that matters every getting new data, we can iterate this process after getting new data and it will help the marketplace for deciding what product should be categorized as exclusive. 

**The data that I get come from here:
